IMOTION DATA DESCRIPTION:

GUI METRICS:
button_click1: "Confirm and keep driving" clicked -> Result
button_click2: "Confirm and stop driving" clicked -> Result
button_click3: "Confirm and cancel trip" clicked -> Result
on_item_clicked: task commenced
Result: performance tracking (n_errors, participant-vs-correct answer)
StartTask: task block begins (taskblock number)
Stop_Tasks: amount of errors (?) -> Nope
Task: task appears (expected answer)
view1: "Front-right sensor" view clicked
view2: "Front-left sensor" view clicked
view3: "Rear-left sensor" viewclicked
view4: "Rear-right sensor" view clicked
view5: "Roof sensor" view clicked
view6: "Inner room" view clicked   (!triggers view2 as well)

NOTES:
- Training time recorded in vp03 -> Manual annotation
- Erroneous task window -> automation's start trigger set to "use last"
- "inner room" (view6) click triggers also view 2 marker
- Stop_Tasks doesn't reports errors, always 0

- sv01 stimlus not present -> video file with wrong name
- sv01 Stop_Tasks missing sometimes -> "use last" start trigger for blocks + manual marker + auto annotation
- sv01 Stop_Tasks a little bit before Result -> manual annotation
	-> some "Task" and "on_item_clicked" markers miss the corresponding "Result" and "button_click{n}"
	-> some "time_on_start" annotations miss the corresponding "time_to_complete"
	-> only 6 blocks
- Can sv01 be added to the 2nd study file?
