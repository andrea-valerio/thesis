# Master’s Thesis

This thesis has been completed for the Master's in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Trento, in collaboration with the Transportation Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig, as part of the European Hi-Drive project.

## 📄 Analyzing Spatial Eye-Tracking Data of Teleoperators to Assess Workload in Automotive Fleet Management
With the rise of partially automated vehicles, teleoperation has emerged as a critical mechanism for remote fleet management. This thesis develops and validates spatial Area-of-Interest (AoI) metrics from eye-tracking data to assess teleoperator cognitive workload. By manipulating task difficulty and presentation frequency in a controlled user study (and incorporating an additional dataset), six AoI metrics (fixation duration, fixation frequency, dwell time, visit frequency, time-to-first fixation, and stationary gaze entropy) were computed over five interface panels. Inferential analyses (two-way ANOVAs) evaluated the effects of difficulty and frequency (RQ1 & RQ2), while predictive models (SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, GBM, XGB, MLP with various sampling techniques) classified binary and multi-level workload states (RQ3). Results confirm workload-driven changes in ocular behavior, demonstrate high predictive performance (> 85 % recall for binary states), and underscore the value of AoI metrics for adaptive HMI design.
